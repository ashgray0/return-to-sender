A 4-channel, CV/touch plate controlled "no-input mixer" for Eurorack.

"No-input mixing" is a primitive method of creating sound popular in the world of noise music. By patching the main outputs of any audio mixer back into its individual inputs, irratic and unpredictable feedback loops are generated without the need for any external audio input (hence the name). These feedback loops can then be shaped by tweaking the level and EQ controls of the individual channels. The results can vary from physical pain to interesting, minimalist rhythms and textures that are impossible to replicate. Here is an example of the latter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxM98JI44OQ.
